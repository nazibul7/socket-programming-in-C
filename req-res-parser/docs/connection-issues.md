# Proxy Connection Behavior: What Was Wrong


## üîç How I found the problem

- First request (like `/auth/login`) worked.
- Second request (like `/auth/register`) failed or hung.
- Browser was reusing TCP socket due to `Connection: keep-alive`.
- Proxy closed both client & backend sockets after one request.
- Verified with:
    # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single request works:
    curl -v -H "Connection: keep-alive" http://localhost:7000/auth/login

    # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reuse TCP for second request ‚Äî fails:
    curl -v -H "Connection: keep-alive" http://localhost:7000/first-path http://localhost:7000/second-path

    * Re-using existing connection!
    * Recv failure: Connection reset by peer


    # 3Ô∏è‚É£ Check socket states:
    netstat -tn | grep :7000


## üìå Situation

1. Browser sends requests with `Connection: keep-alive` (HTTP/1.1 default).
2. Proxy forwards same header to backend.
3. Backend replies with `Connection: keep-alive` and `Keep-Alive: timeout=5`.
4. Proxy relays backend‚Äôs response **without changing headers**.
5. Browser sees `Connection: keep-alive` ‚Üí tries to reuse TCP.
6. Proxy immediately `close(client_fd)` and `close(target_fd)` after relaying.

‚úÖ The backend expects to keep its TCP socket open for more requests.
‚úÖ The browser expects to keep using its TCP socket for more requests.
‚ùå The proxy force-closes both ‚Üí causing hangs, resets, or wasted resources.

## ‚úÖ The Correct Behavior

- Proxy must inject or force `Connection: close` when forwarding request to backend.
- Proxy must or replace original `Connection` headers from browser.
- This tells the backend & browser to close TCP cleanly after responding.

---

## ‚úÖ Future TODO

- For real HTTP/1.1 keep-alive, the proxy must:
  - Track multiple requests per TCP socket.
  - Correctly parse pipelined requests.
  - Keep backend sockets open and reuse them.
  - Implement connection pooling.
